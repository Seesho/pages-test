<h2>November 24, 2016 - Databases</h2>
<p>
  Starting to set up psql. Used homebrew to install it as all the other methods seemed to be really clunky.
  Use createdb to make a database and psql &lt;database&gt; to open said database.
  \d to show all tables and \l to show all databases. Not sure what template0 or template1 is at this point.
  Next goal is to try and import the data from a file to the database:

  This is probably extra stuff but it's still pretty cool for shell scripting.

  Website related: Thinking about embedding videos instead of just linking them.

  Youtube videos already have an html embed link so I can just add them directly.

  Less formatting, just things I was working on today.

  This makes me sad:

  Ultimately caved and looked in the discussions
  <span>n, m = input().split()
#print(n, m)
#nums = input().split()
nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
a = set([int(y) for y in input().split()])
b = set([int(z) for z in input().split()])
happiness = 0
#Naive, straightforward approach
#for i in range(0,int(n)):
#    for j in range(0,int(m)):
#        if(all[i] == a[j]):
#            happiness+=1
#        if(all[i] == b[j]):
#            happiness-=1

#still wrong
#happy = sum([a.count(x) for x in set(all)])
#unhappy = sum([b.count(x) for x in set(all)])
#happiness = happiness+happy-unhappy

#still too slow, why?
#aCount = dict((x,a.count(x)) for x in set(nums))
#bCount = dict((x,b.count(x)) for x in set(nums))
#print(aCount.get('0'), bCount.get('5'))
#x = 1 + aCount.get('0',1336)
#print(x)
#for x in nums:
    #happiness+=aCount.get(x,0)
    #happiness-=bCount.get(x,0)

happiness = [0+1 if x in a else 0-1 if x in b else 0+0 for x in nums]

print(sum(happiness))

  Just logging a quick documentation about Python being pretty cool. Basically the task online was
  average using the set function. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7368789/convert-all-strings-in-a-list-to-int">
  This</a>
  helped me read in a line as a list of ints and proceed with the rest of the practice. Final result is<br />
  <span class = "col-md-12">
    count = int(input())<br />
    nums = input().split()<br />
    results = list(map(int, set(nums)))<br />
    print(sum(results)/len(results))<br />
  </span>
  Also another idea: if I'm going to write blogs every so often, I should have a way to make it from my website instead
  of going into the text editor everytime I want to document something. Other things that come to mind as of now:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Make posts collapsable
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the menu change when the window is smaller than a certain size (for ease of access and OCD)
    </li>
    <li>
      Change the white background
    </li>
  </ul>
  That's all for today! Busy with schoolwork.

<h4>November 15, 2016 - Small edits, plans for the future</h4>
<p>
  Tinkered around with it a bit more and discovered the .otherwise function for the routeProvider. Now I can have
  it default to a certain page if anything goes wrong. I used this
  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_routing.asp">guide</a> from w3schools to figure out
  how to default to a certain route. And then this
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20087627/how-to-create-separate-angularjs-controller-files">post</a>
  helped me figure out how to properly set up my controller in a different file.
  This
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFsduR7mBfY">video</a>
  is just for reference as I plan to implement a search bar, but am unsure if what it will be used for at this point.
  <br />
  I wanted to link all the videos/guides/stackoverflow posts that I found useful in this section as well as what I
  learned from it just as a record for what I learned and how much information there is out there if you just
  figure out what you're looking for. Anyways this is a short post due to all the school work that needs doing
  in the meantime. Hopefully I'll have more time to work on this website as well as other projects to include
  on this website. I'm still developing this website locally before I host it online on GitHub because I still have
  plenty to work on and I need to see the changes faster than GitHub can afford to update. Unless there is a way
  to refresh their cache faster? I'm not sure but this is the way it goes for now.

<h4>November 12, 2016 - Building out this web page is a pain in the butt</h4>
<p>
  Initially I just wanted to build a website with angular and bootstrap because that's what I'm familiar
  with at my work. However I ran into some issues when trying to set it up locally on my machine. I had GitHub
  pages set up for a while now for when I was ready to push my website and just host it online. However, I ran
  into issues when trying to link my pages properly in order to actually test angular's ability to load other
  pages preemptively.<br />
  I checked the developer console to find there is an issue in trying to resolve where the pages were exactly
  routing to when opened independently. So my next course of action was to try to put it on a local server and
  pray that it would fix the issue where I could actually load my other pages from the main page.<br />
  Through this I had to do some digging around for information about Apache. I watched a few videos and read
  through a few guides about to get all the proper configurations set up correctly. It took a while because
  all the information had some permutation of the other and I just needed the right settings for my OS
  (I'm running OS X Yosemite still because I don't like El Capitan). Anyway, it took way longer than I think
  it should have in order to just get the local server working initially. My troubles for this didn't end there
  as I was trying to just test the pages as I was editing them, but only the main page was responsive when
  updating and refreshing. Turns out that chrome cached an old version of my other web pages so I guess I'm
  developing in incognito until another option comes to mind.<br />
  Also since I'm labelling these with dates, I could incorporate like a search function or sorting blogs by date kind
  of thing where clicking on it will open it up. Just more thoughts on how far this web page can go.
